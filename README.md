# Code Refactor Starter Code
Steps taken to refactor the code: 

In index.html:
- changed div class of "header" to the semantic element <header>
- changed the divs in the main sections to semantic element <section>
- changed the div class of "footer" to the semantic element <footer>
- changed the title from website to "Horiseon Search Engine Optimization


In style.css:
- updated the .header styles to reflect the change to the semantic <header> styles
- updated the .footer styles to reflect the change to the semantic <footer> styles

Still to do: 
add alt tags to all images

User Story: 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
